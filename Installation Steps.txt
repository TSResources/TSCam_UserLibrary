Steps to install libraries in TS_Cam are :
_____________________________________________

1. Double click on executable file (before installing it, make sure that cam is already installed)
2. Click --> Install for me only
3. Here select the : c:/ProgramData/TechSmith
	This path is already selected by default but if it is not selected then select this path only.
	Specified path should be inside setup folder text box.

4. Click Next.
5. Click Install

Note:
If installing a new version, then it automatically created required folder heirarchy.
If already installed and updating a newer version, then it does not touch already existing files.

While uninstalling it deletes all of its content from the folder.
But it does not touch any file which is not related to this version.
